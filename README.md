I worked with a company that has the need of drawing hundreds of graphs in PowerPoint. Personally, this is not something to consider in a traditional research framework but I still want to play around with automating the graph generation progress to PowerPoint. This is an incomplete project.

Data from the .xlsx file is processed, calculated before mass-generated into charts in the Powerpoint slides.
